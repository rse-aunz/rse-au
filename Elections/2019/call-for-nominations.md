Interim Steering Committee, I would like to invite nominations for all eight
positions of the inaugural RSE-AUNZ Steering Committee.

To be eligible to nominate for, or vote in the 2019 election, you must subscribe
to the RSE-AUNZ mailing list by  and remain a subscriber until the completion of
the election. Instructions for joining the mailing list can always be found on

To nominate yourself for the election, please submit a GitHub pull request for the
[2019 nominations file](https://github.com/rse-aunz/rse-au/Elections/2019/nominations.md)

All nominations must provide:
* The candidate’s name
* The candidate's contact details (affiliation, email address).

All nominations may optionally provide:
* A statement describing how the candidate will contribute to ensure that the association is diverse.
* A description of the candidate's relevant experience, including:
   * In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.
   * What skills will you bring to the committee?
   * What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?

Following the close of nominations, there will be a one week confirmation period
to determine the eligibility of candidates. If there are more eligible candidates
than positions vacant (8), I will announce a voting period of two weeks, commencing
Monday 23 September 2019.

The [2019 election process](https://github.com/rse-aunz/rse-au/Elections/2019/nominations.md)

I am managing this election process in the role of Returning Officer and
[Sam Moskwa](mailto:Sam.Moskwa@aero.edu.au) has agreed to work as Scrutineer. By
working in these roles, Sam and I are both ineligible to stand for election.
Any concerns or enquiries about this election process can be sent to Sam or me.
