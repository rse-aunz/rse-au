### Diversity Statement

Diversity covers a broad range of categories, not just the protected attributes of gender, age, ethnicity, etc. As a 'Certified Professional Member' of the Australian Computer Society, I will add the experience of a software engineer — practicing in the research domain — to the diverse perspectives that this association aims to represent.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

Over the last 30 years, I have worked in various software engineering roles and industries. However, the last 12 years have been spent applying this experience to the research domain. I have gained an understanding of the aspects of software engineering that are relevant and useful within the research lifecycle from being embedded in a research group and from collaborating with researchers in a diverse range of fields. In addition, I have regularly published papers and presented on software architecture, eResearch, and research software engineering at national and international conferences and forums.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

As a steering committee member, I will bring a high-level perspective that will enable the committee to develop a strategy for growing the RSE community. In addition, through collaboration and communication, I can help the committee to stay focused on delivery, not just discussion. And finally, my excellent minuting skills will never go to waste.


*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I would like the association to have a greater recognition for the breadth of the RSE community in Australia: it's not just 'researchers who code'. In addition, I'd like the committee to fully exploit the goodwill we have built up with national and international organizations, so that we can promote the establishment of regional and local RSE groups. And finally, I'd like to see the committee move towards a formally established organization by the end of 2020.


*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

As a member of the interim steering committee, I have co-convened workshops, BoF sessions, and a mini-conference for the RSE-AUNZ at several national conferences. In addition, I have co-authored and presented the Australian version of the International RSE Survey. I have represented RSE-AUNZ and co-chaired the RSE Worldwide session at the UK's RSE Conference. And have taken a leading role to drive forward the development of the association's 'Goals and Deliverables 2019' and 'Election Process 2019'.

### Diversity Statement

I am a strong advocate of the finding that diverse teams are better performing teams.  This flows into my ongoing recruitment tasks, where I have assembled high-performing teams comprised of people from a range of backgrounds, ethnicities and a balance of genders. My current team at CSIRO is a perfect example!

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

I have a BSc in Computer Science, Master of Information Technology and Grad Dip in Biotechnology & Business.

I have worked as a software developer at Monash University and the Bureau of Meteorology. I am currently leading the Data Analytics and Visualisation Team of eight developers in CSIRO’s Scientific Computing Group.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

During my career, I have occupied many IT based roles in the research support area. These include Senior IT Officer, Divisional IT Manager, Executive Officer, and RSE Team Lead. This experience – including software design and implementation, IT infrastructure support, team management and project management - provides me with a great perspective on the issues affecting individuals across the “RSE spectrum”.

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I’m really keen to see the RSE movement achieve recognition and acceptance in Australia, and for us to contribute to the movement internationally.

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

I have successfully presented abstracts at eResearch Australasia and C3DIS – on Scientific Visualisation and the delivery of eResearch services. My latest co-authored submission to eResearch Australasia is accessible [here](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019_eResearch_24_Brief-Review-of-eResearch-Service-Provision-in-CSIRO-2019.pdf).

*QCIF, Brisbane, Australia*
[heidi.perrett@qcif.edu.au](mailto:heidi.perrett@qcif.edu.au)

### Relevant Experience

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

I have been in the eResearch space for the last 10 years and undertaken various roles in support, development and management during this time.

I can provide insight into what is has been like coming from an IT background into the Research environment and through researcher outreach activities like Software Carpentry, HackyHour & Research Bazaar I have been able to connect with people who have come from a Research background and have found themselves learning IT skills.

I have also been a part of the RSE community and have been an interim steering committee member for the past year.

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

* I would like to see recognition of the skillset crossover (IT and Research) through position description names
* I would like to get a better idea of what type of skills recognition the community is looking for and work towards achieving this
* I would like to start work on a recognised skillset baseline (that is flavour (aka php, python, JS) agnostic) for people in this field already and for those looking to get into it

## <a id="daniel_collins" /> Daniel Collins

*CSIRO, Canberra, Australia*
[daniel.collins@csiro.au](mailto:daniel.collins@csiro.au)

### Diversity Statement

I am a firm believer in the value of diverse teams. A wide range of backgrounds enhances both the team and the organisation to which it belongs. My commitment to diversity is reflected in the software engineering teams I have helped build. For example, a team that I formed in 2010 was dubbed "the United Nations" by team members due to the wide range of nationalities represented. The team was also diverse in both gender and religion. This team achieved great results under tremendous pressure, and the differing perspectives of team members contributed substantially to the outcomes.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science with a major in psychology, and have worked as a professional software engineer since 2000. In 2010 I joined CSIRO. From 2010 to late 2012 I was team lead of a diverse team building web applications for the biosecurity sector. I then moved to the Advanced Scientific Computing group where I have remained to the present day, first as software engineer, and since 2018 as team lead of the Research Software Engineering team. In this time I have worked on research projects across many science domains, from veterinary pathology to radio astronomy.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

I have a deep experience of the challenges facing professional software engineers working in research, both first-hand and through supporting my colleagues and staff. From this experience comes a firm commitment to furthering the agenda of the Research Software Engineering community. Additionally, I have studied and practiced both project management and change management in the last 10 years. My project management expertise will be valuable in coordinating RSE Committee activities and projects, while my change management expertise brings a valuable perspective to any activities that seek effective change. Finally, I also have experience in teaching fundamental software engineering skills and programming to researchers through conference workshops, webinars, and the CSIRO Digital Academy.

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

Despite some improvements, adequate recognition of the contributions of software engineers to research outcomes remains a challenge. Some science domains and research groups do better than others. I believe that the RSE community can play a valuable role by developing and promoting guidelines and practices that ensure that RSEs gain consistent recognition commensurate with their contribution to research outcomes. This is an area that I would like to actively develop.

Secondly, I think that education is important. As a professional software engineer working in tandem with domain scientists, I have for many years seen the problems caused by the lack of some fundamental software engineering skills among researchers who code. I believe that the RSE community can play a role in defining the competencies that make up the RSE toolbox.

Finally, I want to see the RSE community grow and thrive both locally and internationally. My reaction when first reading of the RSE movement was "Yes! Finally a description of what I have been doing for years."

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

I have not formally contributed to the RSE community in the past, and this is exactly why I am applying. I feel a strong connection with the community so it's time to put in some work.

Having said that, many of my activities are relevant. For example, I have taught Python programming workshops focused on scientific applications for several years at the C3DIS conference. I have also taught Python programming through webinars as well as developing and teaching software carpentry material on Python programming for the CSIRO Data School. All of these activities have been fueled by my love of software engineering and my desire to help raise the standard of software engineering practices among researchers.

### Diversity Statement

“Inclusion works to the advantage of everyone. We all have things to learn and we all have
something to teach.” – Kurth and Gross, The Inclusion Toolbox, page 87
This quote was written in a book that talked about implementing research-based strategies
to create more inclusive education programs. Strategies such as these can be implemented
in most scenarios, including building our RSE community. Diversity can come in many forms
and taking it into account can make sure our community is a space for growth, learning,
support, opportunity and this will ensure its sustainability.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

I have completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer science and Genomics,
Postgraduate Diploma in bioinformatics and a MSc in Bioinformatics.

After my Masters I spent 5 years working in the Bioinformatics research, initially in a
commercial environment (a cancer diagnostics company) and then at a University.

I am currently working at NeSI as a research communities advisor, where my role is focussed
on supporting research communities in New Zealand.

I am also currently doing my PhD, where I am looking at using machine learning models to
predict influenza epidemics and pandemics in New Zealand.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

Along with my technical skills, in Bioinformatics and machine learning I am looking forward
to using my community building and engagement skills to the RSE community.

Through my current role and studies, I can contribute by
* delivering training programs (such as carpentries)
* keeping the community engaged
* understanding the communities requirements
* working together with community leaders to achieve goals that we set as a community

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I would like to see RSE’s being recognised for their contributions in research across Australia
and New Zealand. I would like to create stronger relationships with RSE communities in
other countries to learn from and contribute to the local and global community. While
creating strategic direction is important, I would like to convert conversations into
actionable tasks to enable the community to achieve goals .

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

As part of the interim RSE steering committee, I have worked with other committee
members to contribute to RSE community events (i.e. RSE Workshop at eResearch
Australasia 2018, RSE Bof at eResearch NZ, etc.). I participate in interim steering committee
meetings to participate in the planning of RSE community activities.
I have worked with Australian and UK representatives to coordinate the NZ chapter of the
International RSE Survey. I have analysed and presented the finding of this survey in
Australia (ARDC Tech talk) and New Zealand (eResearch NZ 2019, Science coding conference
2019).

### Diversity Statement
At the fundamental level, I see diversity as the natural outcome of creating
equitable and inclusive systems. While research has shown that diverse teams
lead to better outcomes, the fundamental justification for inclusive workplace
systems stems from a fairness viewpoint -- setting up diverse teams is just the
right thing to do.

There are challenges with the balance of representation in the workforce,
particularly within the eresearch sector. In order to improve the
representation, we need to work both at the policy and organisation levels.


### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

I have nearly 20 years of experience in research, including almost 30
publications, numerous talks, conference proceedings. In recent years, I have
also lead and assisted with organising research training activities for
Australian astronomers.

I am a typical example of a Research Software Engineer. I spend a significant
chunk of time writing and debugging code for my research group (ARC Centre of
Excellence, ASTRO 3D). I create and maintaining high-quality open-source
research software and teach other researchers and students how to write
code. Despite all of this necessary work, the primary metric to measure my
productivity is still the number of publications. Consequently, in spite of
being acknowledged as a leader in research software within the astronomical
community, I do not have an academic position commensurate with my experience
and reputation.


*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

I am an academic involved in many aspects of research software --
designing and developing new software, maintaining old code-bases and training
researchers in modern computing practices.  I understand the challenges faced
by both the vulnerable students and postdocs who lack the training to produce
high quality research software. As a founding member of the current RSE
chapter, I have the necessary vision and leadership skills required to create
and sustain a prosperous RSE community.


*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

The key priorities for the RSE community are awareness and recognition for the
RSE role. I am on several national committees in astronomy -- e.g., EMCR
representative at the National Committee for Astronomy (Australian Academy of
Science) and the Early Career Researcher Chapter for The Astronomical Society
of Australia. I will aim to raise awareness for the critical role of software
in research and recognition for the contribution from RSEs.

Also, as a member of the committee, I would like to engage with national
organisations to find concrete ways to improve diversity in the RSE community.


*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

In 2017, I took the initiative to contact with RSE UK to establish the current
RSE Chapter in Australia and New Zealand. As a member of the Interim Steering
Committee, I was involved with nearly all activities undertaken for the RSE
community. These activities include the inaugural round table discussion at
eResearch Australasia, in 2017, remote presentations for UKRSE Workshop (2017),
various local and remote RSE meetups, C3DIS, the international RSE survey in
2018 etc.
